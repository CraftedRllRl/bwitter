# Bwitter
yep

# how to setup??
<h2> NOTE: this is stuff i did for it to work, it'll probably work for you </h2>
<ul>1. install <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">xampp</a> (for hosting)</ul>
<ul>2. Add phpmyadmin and MySQL (for db )</ul>
<ul>3. After all that, delete the stuff in htdocs and add the bwitter stuff in there (I recommend git for this)</ul>
<ul>4. go to php.ini (in apache config buttn) and find ;extension=gd</ul>
<ul>5. delete that ; in there</ul>
<ul>6. Set ur <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/">h-captcha</a> stuff here https://github.com/yukiqt/bwitter/blob/ef30bae07b26692bbd40bbce5a633d8e1156967c/inc/main.php#L248 and https://github.com/yukiqt/bwitter/blob/ef30bae07b26692bbd40bbce5a633d8e1156967c/signup.php#L208</ul>

Boom ur done!!
